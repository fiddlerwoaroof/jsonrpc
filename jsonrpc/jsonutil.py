This module is primarily a wrapper around simplejson in order to make
it behave like demjson

- If an object being encoded has a 'json_equivalent' attribute, that will be called to get a (more)
	serializable object

- if it has an 'items' method, it will be called
	- if it defines both items and iteritems, the second will be used)

- if it is iterable, it will be made into a list

- otherwise 'str' will be called on the object, and that result will be used
